Data Structure Implementation
=============================

Description
-----------

This project implements various data structures using advanced OOP concepts and best practices. The following data structures are implemented:

*   **Doubly Linked List**
*   **Dynamic Array**
*   **Queue** and **Stack** (built on top of the doubly linked lists and dynamic arrays)

Additionally, two projects are included to demonstrate the application of these data structures:

1.  **UndoRedo**: Implements undo and redo functionality using stacks.
2.  **QueueLine Management**: Manages a queue line using queues.

This project also incorporates the previously developed **SaudiDate Library**.

Features
--------

*   **Doubly Linked List**:
    
    *   Print the list and individual nodes
    *   Insert at the beginning, end, and after a specified node
    *   Delete nodes (first, last, specific)
    *   Reverse the list
    *   Find and update nodes
    *   Clear the list
    *   Get the size and check if the list is empty
*   **Dynamic Array**:
    
    *   Print the list
    *   Resize the array
    *   Insert at the beginning, end, and at a specified index
    *   Delete items (first, last, specific)
    *   Reverse the array
    *   Find and update items
    *   Clear the array
    *   Get the size and check if the array is empty
*   **Queue** (using doubly linked list and dynamic array):
    
    *   Push and pop elements
    *   Get the front and back elements
    *   Clear and reverse the queue
    *   Get the size and check if the queue is empty
*   **Stack** (using doubly linked list and dynamic array):
    
    *   Push and pop elements
    *   Get the top and bottom elements
    *   Print the stack
    *   Clear and reverse the stack
    *   Get the size and check if the stack is empty
*   **QueueLine Management**:
    
    *   Issue tickets and manage the queue
    *   Print waiting tickets
    *   Serve the next client
    *   Check the next client in line
*   **UndoRedo**:
    
    *   Set, get, undo, and redo values
    *   Print undo and redo stacks

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1.  Open Visual Studio.
2.  Open Team Explorer (`View` > `Team Explorer`).
3.  Click on `Connect` > `Clone`.
4.  Enter the repository URL and local path, then click `Clone`.
5.  Open the cloned repository and double-click the `.sln` file.
6.  Build and run the project.

These steps will help you clone a C++ project from a Git repository and get it running in Visual Studio.

Conclusion 
---------- 
The **Data Structure Implementation** project showcases the practical application of advanced OOP concepts and best practices in C++. 
By independently implementing essential data structures such as doubly linked lists, dynamic arrays, queues, and stacks, and extending their functionalities through comprehensive operations, 
this project emphasizes the depth of understanding and skill in handling complex programming tasks.
